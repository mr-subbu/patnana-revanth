   <h3>Hello,I am<strong> <i><u>Patnana Revanth</u></i></strong>.I am a student studying in AP-IIIT RGUKT(Rajiv Gandhi University of Konowledge tecnolgies),ONGOLE.</h3>  
 
<h2><b><i>This is my small attempt to tell about my skills</i></b></h2>
  <h2 style="background-color:#ff66ff;border:5px solid #ff3300;color:black;"><i><b>ABOUT</b></i></h2>
   <p>I was born in a village called Borubhadra in Santhabommali mandal which is in Srikakulam district of Andhra Pradesh state.I was born in a middle class family.
My parents are Patnana Triveni and Patnana Appann.My father was a tailor and my mother was a house wife.My father started a Ladies corner due to increasing financial burdens.I also have a younger brother.
His name is Navadeep.He is also a student of RGUKT.My grandmother was also there when I was born but she died when I was studying in fifth standard.
That was the first time I saw tears in my father's eyes and that incident caused me great pain.At that moment I thought very strongly that I would never tear my father's eyes.</p>


<p>My father bought a portion of his elder brother's house from his elder brother in the beginning of my primary education.My father had to borrow money to buy that part of the house from his elder brother.My father took good care of us even when we were having a hard day.
However, my father used to send us to a private school.A few years later, when I reached the eighth class, my parents built a good house with their hard work.Now my parents are taking good care of me and my brother, they give me and my brother whatever we ask for.</p>


<p>I am very curious in learning new things.I like editing and I am always editing photos and videos.
</p>
 


<h2 style="background-color:#ff66ff;border:5px solid #ff3300;color:black;"><i><b>MY EDUCATION LIFE</b></i></h2>

  <p>I started my schooling in a private school called Arunodaya which is located in a village called Pinnintipeta which is some distance from my village.
My entire primary education was done in Pragathi School that too in a village called Priyagraharam which is some distance from my village.I was never a good student from my first to fifth class.Once my father got angry with me because I got very low marks in the exams.
After that, in the final exams, I studied well and got 10th rank in the class. When I told my father, he was very happy.After my primary education I asked my father to join me in a government school but my father did not agree.So I convinced my father and joined a government school.
</p>


<p>All my secondary education was done in Borubhadra Z.P.H.School.My best friend Vijay, who studied with me from my first class to my fifth class, joined with me in government school.Competition in my class was the first reason why I started trying to read little by little from my sixth class.I increased 
my study skills well.My best friend Vijay who competes with me in studies here always gives me good competition in studies and I study with double enthusiasm because of him.He is my perfect opponent and my dearest friend.
In my secondary education I made another best friend Chandu who was always my companion.Also I have made good friends in my secondary education they are L.Mani,k.Nithin,Rambabu,G.Mani,S.Nitin,Tirupati,lokesh and sanjay.So after a few days of joining the government school, I started studying well

But I have never been one to play games everytime.</p>

<p>In my 8th class,Every year NMMS scholarship test is conducted by the government to help the poor students studying in government school only.
I also applied for it along with my friends Vijay and Chandu.We went to Santabommali for the practice test of that test.But I did not do well in it,But I did not do well in it.After that I wrote the actual test with the help of our school teachers and tuition teacher.One day I came home from tuition and my father put his hand on my shoulder and said that I got N.M.M.S seat.
Then I was very happy.At that moment the happiness in my parent's eyes brought me great joy and comfort to my mind.Then I thought in my mind that I should never take this happiness away from them in my case.So I wrote some competition exams in class 9th and 10th in some of them I succeed in some of them I didn't succeed I didn't suffer from defeat,But I learned many new lessons from that defeat.</p>

<p>I love drawing since childhood.I would draw many pictures and show them to my parents and they would enjoy seeing them.I also used to send some pictures to some competetions with the help of my drawing sir.
I used to like giving speeches, so I used to give speeches in school sometimes.I also participate in debates.Due to this, the stage fear also went away from me.</p>

<p>I read very well in tenth class.The government has imposed a lockdown due to Corona.That was the first time I saw my village empty.Finally the government has canceled the public exams due to corona so me and my friends and parents are all very worried.
After that I wrote a RGUKT cet.I got six years integrated btech seat in RGUKT.I have completed my two year PUC in RGUKT.Currently I am studying first year of engineering in ECE branch of RGUKT.</p>

<h2 style="background-color:#ff66ff;border:5px solid #ff3300;color:black;"><i><b>MY LIFE WITH MY FRIENDS AND RELAIVES</b></i></h2>
<p> we have many relatives on my father's side and on my mother's side, we have a very big family.I and my brother, elder sisters, elder brothers, younger brothers,brother-in-laws and sister-in-laws all are used to enjoy very much in any event related to us or related to our relatives.
We went to many places with them and learned new things, among them Gandahati Waterfall,chilka lake etc..,.Now I have to say about my younger brother, with him I always quarrel and share my every happiness with him.He is very active.He participates well not only in studies but also in other fields.
He was always with me.</p>

<p>And when it comes to my friends, Nitin is my best friend who has been with me since I was a months old baby.He was with me in everything and shared all his joys and sorrows with me.And all my other friends are Swaroop,Kranth,Sai Nithin,Karthik,laxmi raj and others.I used to go to many places with them and learned new things there.My friends and I formed a youth organization in my sixth class.
Its name is Jai Ganesh Youth.Since then we used to conduct good events for every Vinayaka Chavthi and we organise them very well.We have been conducting them since almost seven years.During these seven years we have become a 40 members and continue to do so.We have also made a logo for this youth organization.
We have been conducting JGY Talent Test since last two years to help poor students.We are helping those who won the talent test by giving good cash prizes.I also like organizing such events.During the Corona lockdown, I did better in games than before with my friends.My father also used to teach me the settle game.This is the journey of my life made with my relatives and my friends.
</p>

<h2 style="background-color:#ff66ff;border:5px solid #ff3300;color:black;"><i><b>WHAT I HAVE LEARNED IN MY LIFE SO FAR</b></i></h2>
<p>What I have learned in this journey of my life is that those who work hard are never at a loss and always succeed.My parents are my true inspiration.
I learned a lot from my parents about responsibilities and the philosophy of facing difficulties and overcoming them.Finally,I say that my life is dedicated to my parents.</p>
